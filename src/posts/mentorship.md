## The Impact of Teaching

From August 2022 to June 2024, I served as a Computer Science Tutor and Teaching Assistant at Pasadena City College. This experience profoundly shaped how I think about learning and problem-solving.

## Supporting 300+ Students

Over two years, I helped more than 300 students navigate core Computer Science courses including:

- **Data Structures and Algorithms**
- **Object-Oriented Programming**
- **Programming Fundamentals**

## My Teaching Philosophy

### 1. Foster Problem-Solving, Not Just Solutions

I never gave students the answer directly. Instead, I asked guiding questions:
- "What does this error message tell you?"
- "What's happening in memory when you run this code?"
- "How would you break this problem into smaller pieces?"

### 2. One-on-One Mentoring

Every student learns differently. I conducted personalized mentoring sessions to:
- Identify individual learning gaps
- Build confidence through small wins
- Connect concepts to real-world applications

### 3. Collaborative Learning

I worked closely with instructors to:
- Design project-based learning experiences
- Create supplemental materials
- Develop debugging workshops

## The Rewards

Seeing a student's face light up when they finally understand recursion, or watching them confidently tackle algorithms they once found impossible—these moments make teaching incredibly rewarding.

## Lessons Learned

Teaching made me a better engineer. Explaining concepts forced me to:
- Understand fundamentals more deeply
- Communicate technical ideas clearly
- Break down complex problems systematically
- Develop patience and empathy

## Current Mentorship

Today, I continue learning from amazing mentors through Google's Code2Career program, where I'm paired with a Google SWE. It's a reminder that we're all constantly learning and growing.
