## A New Chapter: Game Development

In September 2025, I joined UC San Diego's Qualcomm Institute as a Game Developer Intern, working on **"The Climate Games: Into the Weeds"** - an educational game about environmental challenges.

## Technical Challenges

Working with **Unreal Engine 5**, I'm developing core gameplay mechanics focusing on:

### Character Systems
- Character locomotion (movement, jumping, crouching)
- Animation state machines
- Input handling and response

### Game Mechanics
- Resource management systems
- Physics-based interactions
- Inventory systems

### Player Experience
- Immersion through environmental design
- User feedback integration
- Iterative gameplay refinement

## Development Philosophy

I'm using both **C++** and **Blueprints** to build robust, scalable, and well-documented game systems. The goal is to create mechanics that are:

- **Intuitive**: Players shouldn't need a manual
- **Engaging**: Mechanics should enhance the experience
- **Educational**: Teaching environmental concepts through gameplay

## The Learning Curve

Transitioning from robotics and systems programming to game development has been fascinating. Many concepts transfer:

- **Real-time systems**: Games run at 60+ FPS, similar to robot control loops
- **Physics simulation**: Game engines and robotics both need accurate physics
- **User feedback**: Whether it's a game player or robot operator, UX matters

## What's Next

I'm excited to continue building systems that enhance player immersion and contribute to environmental education through interactive experiences.
